Let me kick things off with a mind-blowing story.

Meet Zach Yadegari, a 17-year-old who turned a simple idea into $1.1M/month in revenue. But here's what makes this story special – his path to success started at age 7 with a keyboard and a dream.


🗣️ "Teaching coding for $30/hour at age 10 taught me my first business lesson – trading time for money isn't scalable," Zach shares. Inspired by The Social Network, he pivoted to building products.

His breakthrough came through three key principles:
💡 Start small but think big (His first win: a $60K/year school game platform at age 13)
💡 Solve obvious problems simply (Cal AI makes calorie tracking as easy as taking a photo)
💡 Growth comes from relentless execution (500 influencer DMs → 1% response → massive TikTok success)

The result? His app Cal AI, launched in May 2024, hit the sweet spot between user need and simplicity. No complex features – just point, shoot, and get your calories. At $40/year, it was a no-brainer for users.

The kicker? He's doing all this while attending high school, proving that age, time, and experience are just excuses. Success comes down to solving real problems and executing relentlessly.


So, future founder, what are you waiting for? Your million-dollar idea might be as simple as making someone's daily task 10x easier. 💪
